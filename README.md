## Neural Network XOR
This is a simple neural network in Java which learns XOR calculations.
In the future you should be able to use this code as a library for your projects.

## What exactly does the NN?
This NN is just for testing and learning. It's perfect if you unterstood how a NN functions and want to know how to develop it.
This simple NN calculate every XOR-Operation. The NN knows nothing and learns per iteration.
